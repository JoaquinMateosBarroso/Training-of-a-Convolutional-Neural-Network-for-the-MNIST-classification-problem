The jupyter notebook `Training of a Convolutional Neural Network for the MNIST classification problem.ipynb`, into the `src` folder contains the training and testing of a convolutional neural network for the MNIST classification problem. The notebook is self-contained and can be run on Google Colab.

Access the colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nswWX5i_be9kWBT6lEEF9LErBShK-nlj?usp=sharing).

Take in consideration that the training of the tuner can take a long time. <br>
In case you want to test the notebook without the need of execute the tuner, you can use the `keras_tuner_dir`, which contains the results of the tuner. <br>

Also, in case you are interested in the TensorBoard results, they are saved in the `logs` folder.

The result model is saved in the `model.h5` file.

A brief analysis of the jupyter notebook is available in the `cnn_results.pdf` file.
